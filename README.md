## Glassmorphism Login Form

This is another CSS animation from the Online Tutorials [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mW0Z1T8l7sU&t=3s) I made a few months ago and want to share it here.

This is pure HTML and CSS ONLY!!

I know glassmorphism is not trending anymore, but I really like the effects and slight animation.  I believe this is a nice work where details make the difference.

I hope you like it, code it and [watch it](https://gustavolando.github.io/otGlassmorphismLoginForm/) !
